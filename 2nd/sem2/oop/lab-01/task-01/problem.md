# Task 1: Weighted Average and Pass/Fail

## Description
Using command-line arguments, read three grades (0–100) for a student: quiz, midterm, and final. Compute the weighted average:  

- Quiz: 20%  
- Midterm: 30%  
- Final: 50%  

Then decide whether the student passes (average ≥ 50) and whether the student qualifies for “Merit” (average ≥ 85).  

## Input
Three integers: `quiz`, `midterm`, `final` (via command line).

## Output
- Weighted average (as double, 2 decimals)  
- Status: `PASS` or `FAIL`  
- Merit: `YES` or `NO`
