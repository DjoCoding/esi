# Task 6: Skip and Stop Rules (for-loop with continue and break)

**Description:**  
Read an integer `N` (N ≥ 1). Then read `N` integers one by one. Apply rules:

- If the value is negative, **skip it** (do not count it, do not add it) using `continue`.
- If the value is `999`, **stop early** using `break`.

Compute:
- Sum of accepted values (non-negative and before 999)
- Count of accepted values

**Input:**  
`N`, then `N` integers

**Output:**  
Accepted count and accepted sum.

**Constraints:**  
Must use a `for` loop and both `continue` and `break`.
