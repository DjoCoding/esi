# Task 5: Sentinel-Controlled Sum (while-loop)

**Description:**  
Read integers until the user enters `0` (sentinel). Compute:

- Sum of all non-zero numbers
- Count of numbers entered (excluding `0`)
- Average (if count > 0)

**Input:**  
A sequence of integers ending with `0`.

**Output:**  
Sum, count, and average (2 decimals). If no numbers were entered (first input is `0`), print `No data`.

**Constraints:**  
Must use a `while` loop.
